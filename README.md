# Instagram

After being introduced to Rails applications in the yelp-clone challenge, this weekend challenge was to build a clone of Instagram.

It requires users who can post pictures, comment on pictures, and like pictures. 

The app was also an introduction to Amazon Web Services and the paperclip gem, which enable it to upload and store images. 

To view tests run;

```sh
$ rspec
```

To open in the browser, start the server and visit localhost/3000

```sh
$ bin/rails s
```
